Adding triples from files:

Need a first model, then a second one to sort out which objs are Resources 

First iteration:

For each line:

read in the line from file

split the line 

assign the values of each token to sub, pred, obj

create a resource for each subject

create a property for pred

add all to model 


Second iteration:

get all triples from model1

for each

get object value

if model1 contains that reasource, create a resource 

add the triple to model 2

write the model to file
